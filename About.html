"Roohani" (रूहानी)  is a word derived from Sanskrit, which has a beautiful meaning."Rooh" (रूह) is derived from the 
Sanskrit word "Ātman", which means "soul," or "essence". "Ani" (अनी ) is a suffix derived from the Sanskrit 
word "Anu" (अनु), which means "related to," "belonging to," or "connected with". Together, "Roohani" can 
be literally translated to "related to the soul" or "connected with the spirit." In a broader sense, it means 
"spiritual," "essence," or "soulful". In various languages, including Hindi, Urdu, and Persian, "Roohani" is 
used to describe something that is spiritual, mystical, or related to the soul.<br><br>
